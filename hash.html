  <h2><i>1.My journey of learning programming :-</i></h2>
  <h3>I have started to learn programming like any other student who have to study it as a part of college subjects,starting from Q-basic language,to c and c++,it was a really boring journey but also very useful,as I got some deep  understanding of programming  basics,though it wasn't really one of my interests at that time but certainly I with curious about it,infact sinc childhood, I have felt attracted to this kind of stuff,like laptops,playstations and all kind of smart devices,I loved it,so as the passion came to me at the end of 2023 year,I have launched again on my journey of learning programming, but this time is different cause what motivates me not grades and assignments,but pure passion and excitement,so here I'm.</h3>
  <h2><i>2.Starting off :- </i></h2>
  <p id="2"</p>
<p<h3>The idea of learning programming, or becoming a developer usually comes out of excited people who wants to look cool or smart or both,and that's okay, what isn't okay is just sticking to this image,and igonre the hard work. Get up and start working on your goal.</h3></p>
<p<h3>At first you can start by learning the basics of computer science,and then basics of programming.Try to understand them deeply,and the proccess of learning programming may become easier to you; as there is alot in common between all programming languages.</h3></p>
<p<h3>After you finish of the basics,go and explore all fields of programming,all languages and there uses,just get an idea and do some testing, don't go too deep right now,unless if you felt it's the right place to be in, go ahead and enter it,other than that pray to Allah to chose to you what's better for you, and try to specify your goals and match them with programming fields and then determine yourself,and of course you may ask for and advice.</h3></p>
  <p id="3"</p>
  <h2><i>3.Problem solving :-</i></h2>
  <h3>In your journey of learning programming you might encounter alot of problems and hard tasks to do,and at some point you may reach your limit and quit.
  <p<h3>Though it may seem like the end of the journey,but you didn't notice that this is the real part of learning programming,and that is sloving problems,so I want you to take a step to the back,and look on the whole picture,you will soon realize that you have come along way in this journey,and the fact is,"The more problems you encounter,the more experience you gain and the more skilled you become."</h3></p>
  <p><h3><b>So start learning the hard way,to become a skilled programmer.</b></h3></p>
  <p id= "4" </p>
<p<h2><i> 4.Tools :-</i></h2></p>
<p<h3>Now there is alot of tools and sources you can learn from, so search yourself and test,I will give you what I use to execute my codes, as it's very important to apply what you have learnt into projects.</h3></p>
<p<h3># PC apps :-</h3></p>
<p<h3>The major tool in pc is, "Visual Studio Code",this app is the real deal,as it deals with a lot of programming languages, and plenty of good extensions, so If you have a computer or laptop go on and download the suitable version to your PC right now, believe me it's outstanding and also you can connect it to your phone.</h3></p>
<p<h3>here is a link to Visual Studio Code >> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" >Code </a></h3></p>
<p<h3># Phone apps:-</h3></p>
<p<h3>1.Pydroid3 : a very good app for python learners.</h3></p><p<h3>2.Spck editor : the right tool for web development at phone.</h3></p>
<p<h3>3.Chat GPT :  you may learn alot from this amazing app, so go ahead and install it.</h3></p>
<p<h3>4.Replit : online coding.</h3></p>
<p<h3>5.GitHub : working for others as a team,is a very important skill to programmers,so go on have fun.</h3></p>

<h2><i>5.Refrences</i></h2>

<p<h3>There is alot of refrences to learn coding from,like websites and youtube channels.Don't get distracted by it, try a bunch of them and chose the best one for you,and stick to it.You may take from other sources as well,but keep one main source as a base.</h3></p>
<p<h3>Here is a source that I use regularly and prefer >>
